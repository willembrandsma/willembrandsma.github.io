But then it snaps back into your mind you're turning 70, not 7.<br>But then of Course, you realize the real, evil, sophisticated advantages of<br>being old. In this manual I'm going to tell you a few of the main<br>advantages of oldness.<br>Rule No. 1: you now have even more power over young, stupid, reckless people<br>who waste their money on alcohol and women<br>For instance: You: "Hey young stupid reckless person, go get my cane!" Young<br>stupid reckless person: "WHY!?!"<br>You: "Cus I'm older than you, so git off your blasted bum and GET IT!!!"<br>Another insidious advantage is you can now drive over anyone you want!<br>When the judge asks you why you did it, you simply dismiss it by saying: "I couldn't<br>see him! Besides, he was doing something stupid and dangerous anyways."<br>Then the judge and jury will wander off to another case wondering, "How is<br>walking in the middle if Central Park 150 feet away from any road or path<br>dangerous?"<br>Now be careful! "Rule No. 1" will get you into trouble. You see even though<br>the older you are the more people you can bully, it can backfire. For example, <br>if you're 70 and a 90-year-old guy comes up and orders you to do something,<br>you do it. But then comes smoking. You see, if a guy smokes enough, he can look<br>90 at a mere 20. A while ago , a 92-year-old-great-grandpa thought a 20-year-old<br>cousin was 127, and pretty much became his personal slave.<br>Another disadvantage is the "Curse Of The Leftovers" get's even stronger than<br>before. And ruining you'r attempt to diet, for the magical call of the leftovers<br>wakes you up in the splat middle of the night to forcefully draw you toward<br>the accurst refrigeratore and makes you eat it's curst contents of diet doom!<br>So now that you know the main advantages and disadvantages you should be on your<br>way now. And pleas don't forget about smoking!</p><p><em>-Willem</em></p><h3>Videos</h3><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-0TEJMJOhk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>Random</h3><p><strong>This</strong> is what happend to my test roket ship. <em>-Willem</em> </p><img src="i.huffpost.com/gen/1178814/images/o-ATOMIC-BOMB-BRAIN-facebook.jpg" alt="Huge explosion" width="400"><h2>Links and Notices</h2><p><strong>How to Leave the Planet</strong><br>   1. Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explane that<br>it's very important that you get away as soon as possible.<br>   2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the<br>White House---(202) 456-1414---to have a word on your behalf with the<br>guys at NASA.<br>   3. If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin<br>(ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any<br>friends there either(at, least none to speak of), but they do seam to have a<br>little influence, so you may as well try.<br>   4. If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number<br>is 011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.<br>    5. If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explane<br>that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives.</p><p><em>-Douglas Adams<br>-Get his book or els!!!</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> there is anything that is not working or you would like on this webpage<br>tell me thrue gmail at willemct.brandsma@gmail.com</p><p><strong>Here</strong> are some websites that we think are<br>are really cool!!</p><ul> <li><a href="minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki">Minecraft Wiki <li><a href="http://minecraftmods.com">Minecraft Mods <li><a href="www.minecraftskins.com">Minecraft Skins <li><a href="www.thinkgeek.com">Think geek</ul></body></html>
