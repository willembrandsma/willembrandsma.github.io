<h1>Manual to being 70</h1>
   At first, tuning 70 means finally being able to go too the same<br>
school ase your big brothers and doing a whole bunch of other stuff big<br>
brothers do. But then it snaps back into your mind you're turning 70, not 7.<br>
But then of Course, you realize the real, evil, sophisticated advantages of<br>
being old. In this manual I'm going to tell you a few of the main<br>
advantages of oldness.<br>
Rule No. 1: you now have even more power over young, stupid, reckless people<br>
who waste their money on alcohol and women<br>
For instance: You: "Hey young stupid reckless person, go get my cane!" Young<br>
stupid reckless person: "WHY!?!"<br>
You: "Cus I'm older than you, so git off your blasted bum and GET IT!!!"<br>
Another insidious advantage is you can now drive over anyone you want!<br>
When the judge asks you why you did it, you simply dismiss it by saying: "I couldn't<br>
see him! Besides, he was doing something stupid and dangerous anyways."<br>
Then the judge and jury will wander off to another case wondering, "How is<br>
walking in the middle if Central Park 150 feet away from any road or path<br>
dangerous?"<br>
Now be careful! "Rule No. 1" will get you into trouble. You see even though<br>
the older you are the more people you can bully, it can backfire. For example, <br>
if you're 70 and a 90-year-old guy comes up and orders you to do something,<br>
you do it. But then comes smoking. You see, if a guy smokes enough, he can look<br>
90 at a mere 20. A while ago , a 92-year-old-great-grandpa thought a 20-year-old<br>
cousin was 127, and pretty much became his personal slave.<br>
Another disadvantage is the "Curse Of The Leftovers" get's even stronger than<br>
before. And ruining you'r attempt to diet, for the magical call of the leftovers<br>
wakes you up in the splat middle of the night to forcefully draw you toward<br>
the accurst refrigeratore and makes you eat it's curst contents of diet doom!<br>
So now that you know the main advantages and disadvantages you should be on your<br>
way now. And pleas don't forget about smoking!</p>
